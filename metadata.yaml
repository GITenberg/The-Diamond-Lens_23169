description: In this early science fiction tale, a man so obsessed with his scientific
  research that he will do whatever is necessary to advance his work concocts an elaborate
  scheme to obtain a state-of-the-art lens for his microscope. Once he has the purloined
  lens in place, he finds something in a drop of water that changes his life forever
  -- and prompts his descent into madness.
